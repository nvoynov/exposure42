# 1. Objective & Design Philosophy

This document defines the technical constraints, quality criteria, and architectural requirements for the Visual Design Phase (High-Fidelity UI/UX Specification). All future frontend developments and high-fidelity interface assets must comply with the layout architecture established in the low-fidelity wireframes (`main_layout.svg`, `main_portfolio_view.svg`, `series_view.svg`, `album_view.svg`, `lightbox_view.svg`, `about_view.svg`) and adhere to the strict rules outlined below.

The core philosophy relies on strict monochrome minimalism, high-density cinematic whitespace, and an integrated, cross-media visual thread. The design framework uses the concept of **Analog Photographic Optics** (Focus Screens, Viewfinders, Aperture Blades) to create a subtle yet authoritative signature across all platforms, from a browser tab icon to social media link presentation embeds.

---

# 2. Integrated Visual Identity & Identity Assets

The core brand asset is the **Vector Camera Focus Screen**. This dynamic glyph repeats across multiple scales and layout nodes to unify the platform's visual ecosystem.

## 2.1 Asset Node A: The Adaptive Favicon (`favicon.svg`)

The favicon provides the initial interface anchor inside the client's web browser environment, designed to match the unified square configuration of the core Brandmark.

* **Dimensions & Setup**: Strict square pixel container with explicitly bound XML schemas to enforce validation under rigid OS-level rendering contexts (such as macOS Finder, Ubuntu Eye of GNOME, and Nautilus file systems):
  ```xml
  <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg`" width="32" height="32" viewBox="0 0 32 32">
  ```
* **Visual Composition**: A strict square viewfinder mask layout with an optimized 2px padding offset from the canvas edges. The corner brackets are configured with enhanced thickness (`stroke-width: 1.5;`) via coordinates `M2,8 V2 H8 M24,2 H30 V8 M30,24 V30 H24 M8,30 H2 V24`. The central split-image optics utilize a denser stroke footprint (`stroke-width: 1.8;`) to guarantee high-fidelity icon clarity down to scaled 16x16px environments.
* **Cross-Theme Agnosticism**: Implements a redundant dual-layer stroke technique. A thick white background halo stroke (`width: 3px` or `5px`) sits directly underneath the dark primary artwork (`width: 1.5px` or `1.8px`). This creates an invisible outer outline on bright browser tabs but provides high-contrast neon readability on dark native tabs or private incognito sessions without executing custom DOM script hooks.

## 2.2 Asset Node B: The Header Logo & Structural Splitter

The focus screen asset transfers directly into the website's persistent top navigation zone (Header), serving as a graphic anchor and text separator.
* **Layout Rule**: Positioned inline immediately between the author’s name and the gallery taxonomy text block: `[ AUTHOR NAME ] <focus-screen-glyph> [ GALLERY TEXT ]`.
* **Aesthetic Integration**: Scaled downward uniformly to fit the exact font baseline bounding height (14px to 16px). It acts as a structural divider, echoing a classic analog film camera's viewfinder overlay grid.

## 2.3 Asset Node C: Automated Brand Watermarks (`watermark.svg`)

To protect ownership and establish brand authority over link shares, a specialized, high-definition standalone version of the focus screen glyph is rendered directly on social media previews, mirroring the exact square configuration of the core Brandmark.
* **Technical Spec**: Fixed dimensions of `64x64` pixels with enhanced line weight parameters designed to retain sharp edge definitions across compressed social media timeline matrices. The outer square viewfinder corners use a `2px` stroke profile, configured with a generous 6px breathing room padding offset from the canvas margins via coordinates `M6,16 V6 H16 M48,6 H58 V16 M58,48 V58 H48 M16,58 H6 V48`.
* **Central Optics Rendering**: The concentric microprism rings and split-image rangefinder lines are rendered with an absolute thickness of `2.5px` and embedded with partial opacity attributes (`opacity="0.75"`).
* **System Integration**: The asset includes clean inline XML CSS hooks (`:root { background-color: #121212; }`) to ensure crisp white-on-dark previews inside local OS file explorers (macOS Finder, Ubuntu Nautilus), while executing as an entirely transparent alpha-channel overlay during local command-line ImageMagick compilation cycles.

# 3. Brand Color Palette & Typography Tokens

The Designer must deliver an interactive Design System (UI-Kit) containing components cross-referenced with CSS design tokens.

## 3.1 Color Tokens & Theme Agnosticism

* **Primary Canvas Surface**: High-purity white background (`#FFFFFF`) to mimic white-walled fine art gallery exhibitions.
* **Primary Text & Graphic Lines**: Charcoal deep tone (`#1A1A1A`), avoiding jarring pure blacks (`#000000`) to soften text readability.
* **Interactive Accent Token**: Muted crimson red sub-tone (`#E11D48`). Reserved strictly for interactive feedback triggers, matching an analog camera's recording indicators or active metering systems.

## 3.2 Typography Tokens

The font rendering system must utilize system-ui sans-serif stacks to prevent external font-loading network bottlenecks.

* **Header / Logo**: 22px / Weight: 300 (Light) / Tracking: 2px (Expanded letter-spacing).
* **Album & Section Titles**: 14px / Weight: 600 (Semi-Bold) / Tracking: 0.5px.
* **Body / Meta Text**: 11px / Weight: 400 (Regular) / Leading: 1.5 (Line height multiplier).

## 3.3 Interactive Element States (UI States)

Every micro-interaction icon (Full Screen `⛶`, Copy Link `🔗`, Close Slider `×`, Chevrons `❮` `❯`) must include distinct state declarations:

* **Default State**: Thin stroke (`1px` to `1.5px`), regular neutral tone.
* **Hover State (`:hover`)**: Triggered transition, color switch to Accent Crimson, smooth transform easing (`transition: color 0.2s ease`).
* **Active State (`:active`)**: Subtle scale-down transformation (`transform: scale(0.95)`).

---

# 4. Performance & Asset Optimization Requirements

The frontend architecture prioritizes raw performance, structural minimalism, and rapid Document Object Model (DOM) rendering.

## 4.1 Vector Assets (SVG) Constraints

* **Inline Vector Integration**: Brand assets, UI icons, and the core focus-screen identity icon must be embedded directly inline inside the HTML markup to minimize separate HTTP/HTTPS network handshakes.
* **Payload Muted Weight**: No standalone SVG component may exceed **1.5 KB** total raw payload. 
* **W3C Schema Integrity**: All structural tags must declare a strictly valid namespace structure explicitly positioned as the first attribute:
  ```xml
  <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="32" height="32" viewBox="0 0 32 32">
  ```
* **Structural Hygiene**: SVG nodes must be exported as clean paths, shapes, or basic lines. Embedded bitmaps, rasterized elements (`<image>`), base64 data streams, or redundant graphic editor metadata (e.g., Adobe Illustrator/Inkscape layer attributes) are strictly prohibited.

# 5. Grid System & Responsive Layout Adaptability

The gallery implements a fluid, content-first masonry and asymmetric row wrap engine.

## 5.1 Grid Breakpoint Matrix

The interface wraps dynamically through CSS Flexbox and Grid, omitting rigid pixel-locked containers:

* **Desktop / Large Screens ($\ge$ 1024px)**: Dual columns on *About Page*, 3-to-4 image columns on *Album Views*, horizontal staggered overlap on *Series Entries*, and multi-scale mosaic grids on the home view.
* **Tablets (768px - 1023px)**: Single column content text, fluid 2-to-3 image masonry layouts.
* **Mobile Devices ($\le$ 767px)**: Strict single-column stack layout. Scattered image collage stacks must stack vertically into centralized single-file viewports to prevent horizontal layout overflow (`overflow-x: hidden`).

## 5.2 Spatial Layout Rules

* **Asymmetric Alignment**: The layout relies on visual tension rather than rigid symmetries. When an image row lacks a completing thumbnail, it must float left, leaving an empty structural column placeholder.
* **Dynamic Wrapping**: Photographic thumbnails on the album view page must wrap gracefully below and around the description text block using adaptive flex-grow properties to guarantee full responsiveness across custom monitor resolutions.

# 6. Social Media Previews Architecture (Open Graph Engine)

To resolve the discrepancy between minimal on-site execution and external visual presentation, the automated asset import pipe must build high-impact Open Graph (`og:image`) assets. The imagery must be generated via server-side or local deployment workflows using command-line **ImageMagick** engines.

All outputs must match the official landscape specification ratio of **1.91:1** (`1200x630` pixels).

## 6.1 Global Main Gallery Preview: TODO: describe my new og-index

The primary preview for the home domain represents a structured yet dynamic mosaic grid, reminiscent of a museum gallery exhibition hang.

* **Layout Composition**: Divided into asymmetric multi-scale columns. Features a dominant vertical showcase frame (`400x570`) on the left side, contrasted against changing horizontal cinematic frames and small squares on the right side.
* **Separation Gaps**: Frames are separated by 4px white gutters (`stroke-width="4"`) acting as physical frame passpartouts.
* **Branding**: The high-definition white vector watermark layer is composited at 80% opacity in the absolute lower right-hand corner.

## 6.2 Individual Album Previews: "The Scattered Prints Portfolio"

Individual series links avoid boring square thumbnails, opting to replicate the live chaotic grid collage layout built into the website's portfolio page.

* **Layout Composition**: 5 distinctive photographs chosen programmatically from the target sub-album. Images are scattered across a neutral canvas surface (`#FAFAFA`), using custom scaling and asymmetrical rotations.
* **Layer Z-Index Simulation**: 4 base layers overlap loosely around the edges, while 1 main hero print settles directly in the absolute optical center, anchoring the pile.
* **Physical Realism**: Every print block contains a white frame edge border (`-border 6`) and an algorithmic drop shadow backdrop projection (`-shadow`) to emphasize realistic physical print sheets on a desk.
* **Branding**: Imprints the global white watermark at 70% opacity in the lower-right margin.

# 7. Responsive Image Resolution Framework (Asset Sizing Guidelines)

To enforce instantaneous page loading speeds, content images must be pre-rendered on the server into multiple layout-optimized responsive breakpoints utilizing HTML5 `<picture>` tags or `srcset` source attributes.

The following data matrix defines the concrete dimensions required for deployment (based on standard 2:3 aspect ratio portrait/landscape exposures):

| Device Category | Screen Breakpoint | Recommended Image Sizing | Layout Context / Sizing | Target File Size (WebP/AVIF) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mobile (Previews)** | $\le$ 767px | **600px $\times$ 400px** | Tiny responsive column grids / Mobile feed masonry | $\le$ 80 KB |
| **Tablets & Monos** | 768px - 1023px | **1024px** (Short edge) | Native resolution matching mobile/tablet viewports | $\le$ 350 KB |
| **Desktop Monitors** | $\ge$ 1024px | **1024px $\times$ 1536px** | Full scale native desktop presentation (Soft quality) | $\le$ 500 KB |

## 7.1 Image Optimization Processing Policies

1. **Modern Formats Compression**: Next-generation web image encodings (**WebP** and **AVIF**) are mandatory. Legacy formats (JPEG, PNG) must only serve as conditional fallback parameters.
2. **Exif Scrubbing**: All photographic images must have their non-critical camera metadata strings, GPS parameters, and thumbnail header tracks fully scrubbed via backend utility tools (`exiftool` / pipeline scripts) before deployment to optimize byte delivery over mobile cellular networks. Color space profiles (sRGB) must be carefully preserved.

# 8. Appendix: Informal Visual Lab Clearance View (Future Phase)

An optional, unindexed alternative view (`/clearance/` or `/lab/`) may be deployed to baseline the secondary clearance of intermediate working test prints and physical artist's proofs. This section must reject standard e-commerce tropes, acting as an informal "darkroom diary" or laboratory notebook.

## 8.1 Entry Architecture & Hidden Discovery

* **Discovery Hook**: Access is strictly circumstantial, linked exclusively via an informal textual note within the *About Me* portfolio space. No persistent, high-contrast links or shopping symbols shall appear in the global website layout.
* **Structural Intent**: The interface is optimized to sell physical print sets (bundles of 2–5 thematic exposures) produced as stepping stones during archival testing cycles.

## 8.2 Presentation & Personal Review Typography

Every bundle card is parsed horizontally, splitting the viewport into two balanced fields:

* **Graphic Module (Left)**: Symmetrical display wireframe showing the count and arrangement of physical prints within the set, framed by a muted dashed grid line (`stroke-dasharray="2,2"`).
* **Narrative Module (Right)**: Contains the informal price token ($18–$20 USD range, mirroring raw production costs), basic sizing arrays (Image Size vs Paper Size), explicit paper manufacturer declarations (*Hahnemühle Photo Rag / German Etching*), and a required **Author's Review** paragraph.
* **The "Why" Parameter**: The Author's Review must explicitly document the empirical reason for the print's existence — detailing calibration paths, contrast tests, or texture experiments that led to the final works.

## 8.3 Lightweight Conversion Flow

* **Zero Automation Footprint**: No active data systems, stateful variables, or transaction interfaces are present. 
* **Plaintext Inquiry Anchor**: Conversion relies entirely on a passive text line component: `[ Claim this set via Email ]`. Clicking the block triggers a static `mailto:` protocol passing pre-defined subject queries to secure the specific clearance run.
