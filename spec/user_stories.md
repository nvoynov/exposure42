# Introduction

This document explores set of User Stories for Exposure system (further, the system) that serves as an overview of the system features and establishes base for the scope of the system.

**The Spark**

As an amateur photographer, I want to build a simple, personal web gallery for my top photos with near-zero maintenance and hosting costs, so that I can establish a sustainable digital home and a single source of truth without financial overhead.

# User Stories

## As an Author (User, Gallery Owner)

### Site Design & Layout

I want to have a nice and clean website consisting of three main pages: `/home`, `/series`, and `/about`. The design must be "elegant" yet "humble" — it should not call attention to itself, allowing the presented photographic works to speak for themselves.

#### `/home`

I want the `/home` page to present a "mosaic" of randomly chosen images (7–15 items) of varying sizes and orientations. This image selection must automatically change with every fresh visit or page reload.

#### `/series`

I want the `/series` page to showcase my photo series using an elegant visual metaphor — resembling "an excerpt of 5 album works, scattered carelessly on a desk," accompanied by the title of each series.

#### `/series/particular-series-page`

I want each individual series page to provide contextual text alongside the collection of related images. The introductory text should be elegantly placed on the left, with the image layout wrapping naturally around it.

#### `/about`

I want the `/about` page to be concise and crystal clear, introducing me as the gallery author and providing my primary contact information.

### Responsive Lightbox & Navigation

I want the gallery to feature a built-in, responsive lightbox layout so that when a thumbnail is clicked, the image expands into a full-screen view. The user interface must automatically adapt to any screen size (from large 4K monitors to vertical smartphone screens) and support smooth image transitions.

### Open Graph Support

I want my website to be social-media friendly by providing tailored Open Graph meta images. The `/home` page should generate an OG image that resembles the page's mosaic layout, while each `/series/particular-series-page` should generate an OG image resembling the 5-piece scattered collage layout. An individual image should present itself.

### Gallery Import (Synchronization)

I want the ability to trigger a gallery import at any time whenever I modify my local source folders, ensuring my live web gallery immediately synchronizes with the latest image versions.

I want the import routine to be smart enough to recognize unchanged assets and completely skip image processing for files that have not been modified since the last import.

### Metadata Management

I want the import routine to automatically generate structured album metadata files upon its very first run. These files will allow me to write human-readable descriptions for my work and optimize the site for search engines (SEO), ensuring properly described albums can be easily discovered on the Internet.

My workflow should allow me to establish these metadata files during the initial import, manually populate them with descriptions once, and then run the import again. On subsequent runs, image transformation must be skipped (since the assets didn't change), but the new metadata must be successfully applied to the build.

### Zero-Overhead Deployment

I want the ability to build and deploy my entire static website using a single, straightforward action — preferably a simple CLI command.

## As a Layout Editor (Art Editor)

### Narrative Orchestration Tools

I want to use simple structural text markers (like block divisions and image references) within a clean Markdown file so that I can control the visual layout, direction, and grouping of content without writing HTML tags or CSS styles.

I want my raw text files to remain highly readable and free from technical asset metadata (such as image dimensions or data-attributes) so that I can focus entirely on the pacing, rhythm, and storytelling of the series.

I want to generate a rapid, high-level visual preview of the layout structure directly in my command-line terminal so that I can instantly evaluate the pacing, block distribution, and rhythm of the entire publication before building the full website.

### Applying the Layout Controls

I want to wrap a collection of paragraphs and images inside a text-and-media block (using native `::: ` fenced dividers) and apply a positioning token (like `.layout-left-text` or `.layout-right-text`) so that the website engine automatically flows the text and assets into the correct editorial grid.

I want to create a visual transition (using a `.visual-pause` block) containing only image tokens so that I can deliberately interrupt the reading flow and give the viewer a dedicated space of silence to contemplate the photography.

I want to designate a single, high-impact photograph as a centerpiece (using an `.editorial-hero` block) accompanied by a blockquote so that a critical moment in the journey receives maximum full-screen emphasis and contextual weight.

## As a Visitor

### Deep Linking & Sharing

I want to copy a direct link to any specific photograph within an album so that when I share it with friends, they land directly on that exact image in full-screen view rather than having to scroll and find it manually.

### Smooth Mobile Experience

I want the gallery to load progressively and instantly, even on slower mobile networks, so that I can enjoy browsing high-quality photographs without frustrating blank spaces or laggy interface responses.

### Offline & Returning Access

I want to be able to instantly re-visit previously viewed albums and images even when my device goes completely offline, ensuring I have continuous access to the artwork anytime and anywhere.

### Invisible Interface & Gestures

I want to navigate through full-screen images and close the lightbox using natural physical actions (like keyboard arrows on my laptop or intuitive swipe gestures on my smartphone) so that the website controls feel invisible and immersive.

## As a Site (Site Engine)

### Interface & Scroll Smoothness

I want to maintain a highly optimized and lightweight page structure (DOM) so that rendering a series of 30–50 images remains visually flawless, ensuring continuous 60fps scrolling performance without any micro-stuttering on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Intelligent Resource Loading

I want to strictly defer the loading of heavy image assets (using smart lazy-loading boundaries) until they are just about to enter the visitor's viewport or are triggered by a lightbox click, ensuring minimal initial data transfer.

### Total Self-Containment

I want to operate entirely as a client-side static application without relying on any active server runtime, databases, or third-party APIs, processing all gallery queries and transitions using only local static files.

## As a Search Engine

### Direct HTML Indexability

I want the core website structure, series titles, and image links to be embedded directly within the initial HTML source code so that I can instantly discover and index the portfolio content without being forced to execute complex client-side JavaScript.

### Semantic Context & Metadata Discovery

I want to receive clear textual semantics—such as structured headers, album descriptions, and descriptive image attributes generated from the author's metadata files—so that I can accurately understand the artistic context and properly present the gallery in search results.

### Efficient Crawling Infrastructure

I want to easily navigate the website's hierarchy via lightweight text patterns and a standard sitemap without wasting crawling budget on downloading heavy high-resolution media assets, ensuring fast and optimal indexing of newly published series.

## As an Art Curator / Publisher (Future Scope)

### Institutional Transparency

I want to instantly identify the author, creation year, and official title of any photograph so that I can easily verify its authenticity and reference it in publications or exhibition catalogs.

### Concept-First Presentation

I want to read the artist's contextual statement alongside the imagery within a series, allowing me to evaluate the conceptual depth of the project rather than just viewing isolated aesthetics.

### Frictionless Editorial Contact

I want to find direct, un-obfuscated contact channels and licensing baselines on the `/about` page so that I can quickly secure publishing rights or invite the artist to a physical exhibition without administrative delays.

## As a Fine Art Collector / Curator (Future Scope)

### Unobtrusive Information Access

I want technical metadata (such as titles, years, and print specifications) to remain completely hidden from the primary visual interface, accessible only via intentional sub-pages or quiet, on-demand interactive elements, preserving the pure aesthetic experience for casual viewers.

### Museum-Grade Print Catalogue

I want the print details section to focus strictly on physical and archival qualities—specifically capture date, paper manufacturer/stock, and dimensions—presented as an extension of the author's biography rather than a commercial storefront.

### Direct Inverted Inquiry

I want to initiate print acquisitions through a direct personal email channel rather than an automated checkout system, establishing a thoughtful connection between the author and the collector.
